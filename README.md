Brain Tumor Detection and Classification

Overview

This project focuses on detecting and classifying brain tumors using deep learning techniques. The model processes MRI scans to identify the presence of tumors and classify them into relevant categories.

Features

Preprocessing: Image augmentation and normalization for better model performance.

Model Training:

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network): A deep learning model designed for feature extraction and classification.

FCNN (Fully Connected Neural Network): Used for final classification layers.

Transfer Learning: Utilizes pre-trained models such as VGG16, ResNet, or Inception to improve accuracy and reduce training time.

Evaluation: Assesses model performance using various metrics.

Prediction: Classifies MRI scans into different tumor types.

Evaluation Metrics

Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correctly classified images.

Precision & Recall: Evaluates the model's effectiveness in identifying tumors correctly.

F1-score: Balances precision and recall for better performance assessment.

Confusion Matrix: Provides insights into false positives and false negatives.
